  "readme": "Pokemon Battle\n==============\n\nThis is an automatic pokemon battle simulator born as a fun script for [Hubot](http://hubot.github.com/).\n\nGiven 2 teams of pokemon, the simulator will choose a build of 4 moves for each pokemon and then simulate a battle with an elementary AI.\n\nThe pokemon and moves are up to date to Gen VI thanks to the amazing database from https://github.com/veekun/pokedex.\n\n## Online Version\nCheck out an online version here:  \nhttps://pokemon-battle.herokuapp.com/\n\n\n## Instalation\nYou can install using Node Package Manager (npm):\n\n```\nnpm install pokemon-battle\n```\n\n## Usage\n### One on One Battle\nSimply provide 2 pokemon referenced by their National Pokedex number.\n\n```coffee\npokemon = require 'pokemon-battle'\n\nconsole.log pokemon.battle 59, 135\n```\n\nThe code above will output the result of the battle:\n```\nThe foe's Jolteon used Thunderbolt!\nIt's a critical hit!\nYour Arcanine is hit for 210 HP (65%)\n\nYour Arcanine used Flare Blitz!\nThe foe's Jolteon is hit for 260 HP (96%)\nYour Arcanine is hurt 87 HP (27%) by recoil!\n\n\nYour Arcanine used Extreme Speed!\nThe foe's Jolteon is hit for 11 HP (4%)\nThe foe's Jolteon fainted!\n\nYou defeated the foe!\nArcanine: 24 HP (7%) left.\n```\n\n\n### Team Battles\nBy providing lists of pokemon, you can simulate a battle between 2 teams. For example:\n\n```coffee\npokemon = require 'pokemon-battle'\n\nconsole.log pokemon.battle [25, 196, 143, 3, 6, 9], [18, 65, 112, 130, 103, 59]\n```\n\nYou can also name the trainers, instead the default \"you\" and \"the foe\", by using an object:\n\n```coffee\npokemon = require 'pokemon-battle'\n\nconsole.log pokemon.battle {trainer: \"Red\",  pokemon: [25, 196, 143, 3, 6, 9]},\n                           {trainer: \"Blue\", pokemon: [18, 65, 112, 130, 103, 59]}\n```\n\nOutput:\n\n```\nBlue's Pidgeot used U-turn!\nRed's Pikachu is hit for 103 HP (49%)\nBlue took out Rhydon.\n\nRed's Pikachu used Volt Tackle!\nIt doesn't affect Blue's Rhydon...\n\n\nRed's Pikachu used Grass Knot!\nIt's super effective!\nBlue's Rhydon is hit for 348 HP (99%)\n\nBlue's Rhydon used Hammer Arm!\nRed's Pikachu is hit for 108 HP (51%)\nRed's Pikachu fainted!\nBlue's Rhydon's Speed rose!\nRed took out Blastoise.\n\n\nBlue withdrew Rhydon.\nBlue took out Exeggutor.\nRed's Blastoise used Surf!\nIt's not very effective...\nBlue's Exeggutor is hit for 75 HP (23%)\n\n\nRed's Blastoise used Ice Beam!\nIt's a critical hit!\nIt's super effective!\nBlue's Exeggutor is hit for 256 HP (77%)\nBlue's Exeggutor fainted!\nBlue took out Gyarados.\n\n\nBlue's Gyarados used Earthquake!\nRed's Blastoise is hit for 97 HP (32%)\n\nRed's Blastoise used Ice Beam!\nBlue's Gyarados is hit for 66 HP (20%)\n\n\nBlue's Gyarados used Earthquake!\nRed's Blastoise is hit for 106 HP (35%)\n\nRed's Blastoise used Ice Beam!\nBlue's Gyarados is hit for 70 HP (21%)\n\n\nBlue's Gyarados used Earthquake!\nRed's Blastoise is hit for 96 HP (32%)\nRed's Blastoise fainted!\nRed took out Snorlax.\n\n\nBlue's Gyarados used Aqua Tail!\nRed's Snorlax is hit for 188 HP (41%)\n\nRed's Snorlax used Double-Edge!\nBlue's Gyarados is hit for 195 HP (59%)\nBlue's Gyarados fainted!\nRed's Snorlax is hurt 65 HP (14%) by recoil!\nBlue took out Alakazam.\n\n\nBlue's Alakazam used Focus Blast!\nIt's super effective!\nRed's Snorlax is hit for 208 HP (45%)\nRed's Snorlax fainted!\nRed took out Espeon.\n\n\nBlue's Alakazam used Shadow Ball!\nIt's super effective!\nRed's Espeon is hit for 187 HP (69%)\n\nRed's Espeon used Shadow Ball!\nIt's super effective!\nBlue's Alakazam is hit for 175 HP (70%)\n\n\nBlue's Alakazam used Shadow Ball!\nIt's super effective!\nRed's Espeon is hit for 84 HP (31%)\nRed's Espeon fainted!\nRed took out Charizard.\n\n\nBlue's Alakazam used Psychic!\nRed's Charizard is hit for 179 HP (60%)\n\nRed's Charizard used Earthquake!\nBlue's Alakazam is hit for 76 HP (30%)\nBlue's Alakazam fainted!\nBlue took out Rhydon.\n\n\nRed's Charizard used Air Slash!\nIt's not very effective...\nBlue's Rhydon is hit for 3 HP (1%)\nBlue's Rhydon fainted!\nBlue took out Arcanine.\n\n\nRed's Charizard used Earthquake!\nIt's super effective!\nBlue's Arcanine is hit for 161 HP (50%)\n\nBlue's Arcanine used Wild Charge!\nIt's super effective!\nRed's Charizard is hit for 118 HP (40%)\nRed's Charizard fainted!\nBlue's Arcanine is hurt 30 HP (9%) by recoil!\nRed took out Venusaur.\n\n\nBlue's Arcanine used Flare Blitz!\nIt's a critical hit!\nIt's super effective!\nRed's Venusaur is hit for 301 HP (100%)\nRed's Venusaur fainted!\nBlue's Arcanine is hurt 100 HP (31%) by recoil!\n\n\nBlue defeated Red!\nPidgeot: 307 HP (100%) left.\nAlakazam: 0 HP (0%) left.\nRhydon: 0 HP (0%) left.\nGyarados: 0 HP (0%) left.\nExeggutor: 0 HP (0%) left.\nArcanine: 30 HP (9%) left.\n```\n\n\n### Checking a Pokemon's Moves\nYou can also check which moves the simulator chose for a given pokemon.\n```coffee\npokemon = require 'pokemon-battle'\n\nconsole.log pokemon.build 9\n```\n\nWill show Blastoise's moves:\n```\nSurf (Water - 90 power - 100 accuracy)\nEarthquake (Ground - 100 power - 100 accuracy)\nIce Beam (Ice - 90 power - 100 accuracy)\nFocus Blast (Fighting - 120 power - 70 accuracy)\n```\n\n### Looking Up a Pokemon Number by Name\nThe `lookup` function allows you to obtain the National Pokedex number of a pokemon by its name.\n\n```coffee\npokemon = require 'pokemon-battle'\n\npokemon.lookup 'Blastoise' #Returns 9\n```\n\n\n## About the AI\nWhen choosing a move, the AI will consider its base power, as well as accuracy, type and governing stat.\n\nFor example, Hydro Pump has a power of 100, but its 80% accuracy makes it a worse choice than Surf, with 90 power and 100% accuracy. However, Gyarados will prefer Aqua Tail (90 power and 90% accuracy) over both because it's a physical move and its attack stat is much higher than its special attack.\n\nSome move side-effects will also affect the decision. For example, a pokemon with low HP will favor a healing move like Giga Drain and shun moves with recoil like Double-Edge. Also, if a pokemon thinks a high priority move like Quick Attack or Extreme Speed will finish off the opponent, it will chose it over standard-priority moves.\n\nLet's analyze the following battle:\n\n```\nYour Sawsbuck used Double-Edge!\nThe foe's Audino is hit for 158 HP (46%)\nYour Sawsbuck is hurt 53 HP (18%) by recoil!\n\nThe foe's Audino used Fire Blast!\nIt's super effective!\nYour Sawsbuck is hit for 170 HP (56%)\n\n\nYour Sawsbuck used Horn Leech!\nThe foe's Audino is hit for 107 HP (31%)\nYour Sawsbuck healed 54 HP (18%)!\n\nThe foe's Audino used Ice Beam!\nIt's super effective!\nYour Sawsbuck is hit for 132 HP (44%)\nYour Sawsbuck fainted!\n\n\nThe winner is the foe's Audino with 82 HP (24%) remaining!\n```\n\nFor the first move, both pokemon went in guns blazing with the moves that would deal the most damage.\n\nHowever, for the second move Sawsbuck at nearly half HP favored the healing move Horn Leech over the recoil move Double-Edge, while Audino prefered Ice Beam over Fire Blast because, while both moves would have killed the opponent, Ice Beam had a higher accuracy.\n\nNote that since the implementation of Jump Kick, Sawsbuck will use this move against Audino. I'll leave this example, however, because it showcases several of the many situations that can arise during a battle.\n\n## Future Development\nThe following elements are still unsopported, but I'd like to include them in future versions.\n\n- Non-damaging moves\n- Abilities\n- Held items\n- EVs\n \nThere are also many damaging moves which were not implemented due to having complex restrictions or side effects, such as Transform, Hidden Power, Synchronoise, Flying Press and multi-turn moves like Fly or Hyper Beam\n\nFor a full list of these effects and their level of support, see the [list of move effects](https://github.com/fonse/pokemon-battle/blob/master/docs/effects.md).\n",
